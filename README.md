# Tsuki discord bot


### this repository might become the main one over time, when we will reach the state of development of the main repository, it will progressively take the place of the main repository for my bot and the other one will probably be deleted
Tsuki for testing purposes and new discord.js migration, discord bot

for this git repo don't expect good gestion, i will only work on the main branch since i consider that a test repo is not really useful to setup git flow or anything like that
